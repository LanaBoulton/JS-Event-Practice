# JS-Event-Practice

	•	The h1 should start with the text "Enter Your Username" 
	•	Whenever an input event is fired on the <input> element, update the <h1> 
                so that it displays "Welcome, " plus the current value from the text input.  
                Take a look at the gif below to see how it should work.
	•	If the <input> goes back to being empty, update the <h1> so that it once again 
                says "Enter Your Username"
